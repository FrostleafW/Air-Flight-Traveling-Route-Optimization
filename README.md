## Project Title: Air Flight Traveling Route Optimization

### Problem
<ul>
  <li>Finding the most optimal path with regard to airport/population size of air flight traveling from city to city.</li>
</ul>



Motivation: Why is this a problem? [0.25 point]
This implementation can be used to save the airplane industry billions of dollars of resources and labor cost. It will create an optimized system for routes based on population and flight availability.
Features: When do we know that we have solved the problem? [0.25 point]
Manually create test cases for most optimal routes
Compare industry used routes with ours
Create a website to house the visualization
Users can search for cities
Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the most efficient routes
Data: (Public data set we will be using and the link to the public data set) or (Schema of randomly generated data - i.e. what are the different columns in our dataset and the respective data types) [0.25 point]
